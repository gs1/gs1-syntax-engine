* Core: New DIGSIG_SERIAL_KEY validation function to ensure that keys include a serial component when used with AI (8030).
* Core: Support for new Syntax Dictionary AI group syntax (e.g. "01+21") for req attributes where each listed AI must be present to be a satisfactory the constraint.
* Core: Ensure that valid key-qualifier AIs appear in path info, where possible, rather than in query parameters.
* Java: Build process amended to treat warnings as errors.
* Where possible, use compiler and language features to mark depreceated functions as such in C library and bindings.

  AI mandatory associations) to be differentiated and enabled/disabled by the
  library user.
* Wrappers: Add support for new {get,set}ValidationEnabled API functions.
* Core: {get,set}ValidateAIassociations API functions are now deprecated since
  the new validation function table functionality subsumes the legacy
  functionality.
* Core: Deprecated setValidateAIassociations no longer disables
  mutually-exclusive AI validation. (Mutually-exclusive AI validation is now
  mandatory.)
* Wrappers: Replace deprecated {get,set}ValidateAIassociations API functions
  with new {get,set}ValidationEnabled.

* C# .NET: Expose "permit zero-suppressed GTIN in GS1 DL URIs" option in the
  desktop app.
* JS: Expose "permit zero-suppressed GTIN in GS1 DL URIs" option in the Node.js
  application.
* JS: Expose "permit zero-suppressed GTIN in GS1 DL URIs" option in the browser

  as space in a query parameter, not a path component, per rules for
  interpretation of URIs and CGI.
* Core: In GS1 Digital Link URIs, represent "+" characters in AI expressed in
  path info as "%2B", per GS1 preference.
* Core: Add support for GenSpecs CSET 64 required by Digital Signatures.
* Core: New permitZeroSuppressedGTINinDLuris API option (default false) since
